        <h2>About CodeLab</h2>

        <p>By now, you've hopefully tried CodeLab. The idea behind
            CodeLab is that it's a "safe" place to practice small bits
            of programming -- for example, getting used to the
            differences between Java and C++ syntax.</p>

        <p>Don't be afraid to play around, to try lots of things
            that end up not working. CodeLab does keep a history of your
            attempts, but that's to help both you and me get a handle on
            what you're not understanding. If you're struggling with a
            CodeLab exercise, you can email me and ask for help on
            problem #12345, and I can log in, see what you've tried, and
            give you advice.</p>
        <p>For grading purposes, my main concern is simply the
            number of exercises you've eventually gotten corrent; I
            don't care about how many attempts you've made. You'll get a
            little bit of credit, too, for exercises where you've made a
            valiant attempt but couldn't quite get it.</p>

        <p>You'll either get email from me, or see a posting on the
            calendar page, when there are new CodeLab exercises
            assigned; you should generally assume that a new batch will
            be assigned very shortly after one has become due.</p>
