        <h3>Bulletin Description</h3>Introduction to essential topics for modern software application development: Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming and human-computer interaction; computer graphics; networks, security, and client-server computing, including web applications. Code development by example, and modification of instructor-authored code using Java, emphasizing its graphics and networking capabilities. Contemporary programming development environments and tools including Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Students should be prepared to take Computer and Information Science 3140 in the following semester.

        <h3>Prerequisites and Corequisites</h3>I expect you to have successfully completed CISC 3110 and thus be fairly knowledgeable about programming in C/C++, including fundamentals of object-oriented programming. I strongly recommend that you take CISC 3130 (Data Structures) while you are taking this course, so you can move directly into CISC 3140, the sequel to this course, next semester.

        <h3>Schedule and Course Material</h3>The one required textbook for this course is <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023463.do">Learning Java, 4th Edition</a></em>, published by O'Reilly. This book is written for experienced programmers who need to learn Java. This is you. It's perhaps less 'gentle' than other programming texts you may have encountered; it assumes you already know something about programming. Feel free to seek out gentler introductions to Java; the free online textbook <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">Introduction to Programming Using Java, Seventh Edition</a> is a solid choice. You might also get something out of Oracle's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/">Java Tutorials</a>. And you will <em>certainly</em> need to become comfortable navigating the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Java API documentation</a>. I will be occasionally be posting additional required readings, videos, etc, on the <a href="calendar.html">course calendar</a>, which tells you about the topics we'll be discussing, and the reading you need to do in advance of, each day. I'll also post links to the required readings, as well as supplemental texts, on the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.

        <h3>Grading Policy</h3>Your work in this class will contribute to your final grade as follows:

        <p>20% Midterm Exam<br />
        30% Final Exam<br />
        <br />
        10% <a href="codelab.html"></a>CodeLab</a> (see below)<br />
        20% Programming Projects<br />
        20% In-class Activities</p>
        
        <h3>Contacting Me</h3>
        
        Coming to my office hours is the best way to get my undivided attention. If that's not possible or timely, then email is far more effective than the telephone. If you call my office during office hours, I will answer if I'm not with another student; at other times, I may not answer. The college's voicemail system is clunky and time-consuming; if you leave me a voicemail, I will probably never listen to it. Email me instead. Make sure the subject of your email begins with <b>CISC 3120</b> to make sure I give it quick attention. If you email me after 9pm or over the weekend, I may not respond until 9am the next weekday morning.

        <h3>College Policies and Resources</h3>
        
        <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

        <p>The faculty and administration of Brooklyn College and the City University of New York support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for implementing that policy can be found here: <a href="http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/la/Academic_Integrity_Policy.pdf ">http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/la/Academic_Integrity_Policy.pdf</a>. According to this policy, "A faculty member who suspects that a student has committed a violation of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy shall review with the student the facts and circumstances of the suspected violation whenever feasible. Thereafter, a faculty member who concludes there has been an incident of academic dishonesty sufficient to affect the student's final course grade shall report such incidents...."</p>
        
        <p> I take this policy very seriously. Among the actions which may constitute a policy violation in this course:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Copying from another student during an examination or allowing another to copy your work;</li>
<li>Unauthorized collaboration on a take home assignment or examination;</li>
<li>Using notes during a closed book examination;</li>
<li>Allowing others to do assigned projects, including use of commercial services;</li>
<li>Copying another person's code without attributing the source.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for understanding the entirety of CUNY's policy; if you have questions, don't hesitate to ask me.
</p>
<p>In particular, if I determine that part or all of one coding assignment has been copied from another, <em>all</em> students involved will get a <b>zero</b> on the assignment. You are responsible for safeguarding your work.</p>

<h4>Accommodation for Disability</h4>

        <p>In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, Ms. Valerie Stewart-Lovell at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide me with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with me. I will be more than happy to help.</p>

<h4>Career Services</h4>
        <p>The College has an excellent career center; it's never too early to start preparing for your career. If you're interested in preparing a resume, finding a job or internship, connecting your college experience with a career or developing professional skills, visit the Magner Career Center at: 1303 James Hall, call 718-951-5696 or sign up for workshops and jobs and internship notifications on the WebCentral Portal (http://portal.brooklyn.cuny.edu).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Complete all assigned "CodeLab" exercises, which allow you to "drill" on elements of the Java programming language, by their deadlines (I'll give you more information in the first few days of class.</li>

            <li>Complete all assigned readings, etc, <em>before class</em> on the day they are due. You should <b>expect short quizzes</b> on these readings, and possibly on the previous day's activity, which will be easy if you pay attention in class and complete the reading on time.</li>

            <li>Complete all assigned programming projects, which you will mainly work on outside of class, by their due dates.</li>

            <li>Attend and participate in class, including a variety of pair- and team-based exercises.</li>

            <li>Demonstrate your mastery of Java practice and programming on the midterm and final exams.</li>
        </ul>In addition, I expect you to

        <ul>
            <li>Ask questions in class, or come see me in office hours, if you are confused.</li>

            <li>Let me know if, for any reason, you're having trouble meeting these expectations&ndash;don't vanish!</li>
        </ul>In return, you can expect me to:

        <ul>
            <li>Come to class with energy and enthusiasm.</li>

            <li>Work to make the course material as comprehensible as possible, and to reveal its inherent interest.</li>

            <li>Return graded homework assignments and exams promptly.</li>

            <li>Hold you to high academic standards.</li>

            <li>Be sensitive to external demands that may affect your participation and performance.</li>
        </ul>
