        <h2>About GitHub</h2>

        <p>
            You should have a GitHub account now. Before you read any
            farther, go to this <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-PZFg25TkAM7lELC7U-4wtnXtLhwLfTdGZSDkjRFoyw/viewform">very
                short survey</a> and tell me what your GitHub username is.
        </p>

        <p>
            GitHub is, roughly speaking, a hosted source code management
            solution (though it can manage all kinds of project, not
            just software development). It uses the rather awesome
            software <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. It is a <em>distributed</em>
            source code management tool, which means that it's very easy
            to work on code with multiple collaborators (a few, a few
            hundred...), very easy to work on your code from multiple
            locations, and also very easy to keep track of your work,
            try different approaches, and decide what you want to keep
            and what you want to discard. For the purposes of this
            class, there are two fairly limited uses we'll have for
            GitHub:

            <ul>
                <li>You'll be able to see whenever I change
                    something on the course website</li>
                <li>I'll be able to distribute code for programming
                    projects, and grade your work, without paper, email,
                    etc.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <p>So, first: all the published material for the course
            (including this page) is in a GitHub repository at</p>

        <p>
            <a
                href="https://github.com/BC-CISC3120-F14/BC-CISC3120-F14.github.io">https://github.com/BC-CISC3120-F14/BC-CISC3120-F14.github.io</a>
        </p>

        <p>If you "Watch" this repository, then any time I send
            changes to the site on GitHub, you'll get a "notification"
            -- you can configure those, to some extent, in the
            "Notifications Center" section of your GitHub settings page.</p>

        Second: assignments. Once I have your GitHub username, I will
        make you part of the class "organization" on GitHub. For each
        project I assign, I will create a "private repository" for you,
        with a copy of the assignment and any 'skeleton' code the
        project needs. You will "clone" this repository to whichever
        computer you're using, make changes to the project there, and
        regularly "push" your work to your private repository on GitHub.
        If you have questions, you can ask me about them and I can just
        look at your code on GitHub. When it comes time to grade, I will
        clone your repository to my computer, then push it back with my
        grading comments. And yes, I'll give you instructions about how
        to do all of this: it takes a little time to get used to, but
        it's a very powerful way of working with code.
